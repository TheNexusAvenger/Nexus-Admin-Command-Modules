# Nexus-Admin-Command-Modules
The Roblox model files contain the source code of all the non-internal commands used in Nexus Admin. Free to modify and place into the loader to override the bundled versions. Forking the original code without modification isn't recommended as bugs can't be automatically updated. Bugs that are found should be reported to be directly or submit a but report under Issues.
